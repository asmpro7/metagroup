Description: Provides a suite of tools to perform meaningful subgrouping in a
    meta-analysis. This is a two-step process; first, use the iterative
    grouping functions (e.g., 'mgbin', 'mgcont') to partition studies
    into statistically homogeneous clusters based on their effect size
    data. Second, use the 'meaning' function to analyze these new
    subgroups and understand their composition based on study-level
    characteristics (e.g., country, setting). This approach helps to
    uncover hidden structures in meta-analytic data and provide a deeper
    interpretation of heterogeneity.
