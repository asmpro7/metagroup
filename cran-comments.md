## CRAN Resubmission for metagroup 1.0.2

This is a resubmission.

In response to reviewer feedback, I have made the following changes:
* The `DESCRIPTION` file has been updated to remove redundant phrasing and to format function names with `()`.
* A detailed `@return` value section has been added to the documentation for the `grouped.Rd` help file, as requested.
* Regarding the suggestion to add references, none are included at this time as the package implements a novel methodological approach.

Thank you again for your time and consideration.
