## CRAN Resubmission for metagroup 1.0.1

This is a resubmission.

In response to reviewer feedback, I have made the following changes:
* The `License:` field in the DESCRIPTION file has been changed from `GPL-3 + file LICENSE` to `GPL (>= 3)`.
* The redundant `LICENSE` file has been added to `.Rbuildignore` so they are present on GitHub but not in the CRAN package bundle.

Thank you for your time and consideration.
